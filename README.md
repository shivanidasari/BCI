# BCI for Mental State Analysis

This project focuses on building a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system to analyze and classify different mental states based on EEG (Electroencephalogram) data.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The main goal is to monitor brain activity and detect various mental states (like relaxation, concentration, stress) using machine learning techniques and EEG signal processing.

## 🚀 Features

- EEG signal acquisition and preprocessing
- Feature extraction from EEG signals
- Machine Learning model training and evaluation
- Mental state classification
- Visualization of brain activity patterns

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MATLAB** / **Python** (for signal processing and ML)
- **EEG Hardware** (OpenBCI, Emotiv, Muse, or similar)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)
- **MNE-Python** / **EEGLAB** (for EEG data analysis)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for plotting results)
